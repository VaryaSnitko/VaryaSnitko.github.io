<h1> What is 30MFF?</h1>
<p class="description"> If you are a new user, our <a href="team.html">team</a> is happy to invite you to the Thirty Minutes Film Festival. We are students of New York UNiversity, which is located in Abu Dhabi. This semester (spring 2021) we are taking Communication Lab class from Interactive media department. As you may know the COVID-19 pandemic made sudden, drastic changes to course curricula. All students are doing online courses since spring 2020. All professors and students use the ZOOM platform for online classes, thefore you can understand where title of the video came from. So, from the very first class we started to make steps to our big projects. The first task was to make a video related to any topic. We were placed into breakout rooms of 3 to discuss what we are going to create. To be honest, during this part of the class we had different technical issues with our hardware and connectivity. Sometimes problems inspire... That is why we decided to connect humor and everyday routine to support other students. 
During 30MFF other students also shared their videos, most of them about campus, because fortunately some of the students arrived on campus. The next step after video was to create wireframe of our future website to upload our video and the last as you've already guessed is this website :)

We hope this little video would be only as reminder to the  next generations to realize how it was in the past see people only throughout the screen
